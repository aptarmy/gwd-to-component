\t "GWT To Component" is a standalone package intended for those who want to use Google Web Designer as a web component.

\t Command Line reference
\t gwd-to-component -s /path/to/gwd/output/folder -c container-id -l link-import-id -u http://yourhosting/components/widget-1

\t -s \t is Source folder from Google Web Designer output without trailling slash.
\t -o \t is Output folder generated from this package without trailling slash. The Folder path you spacified must exists
\t\t otherwise errors will occure. This package will create subdirectory named "gwd-to-component-output" in that directory.
\t\t for example if you spacify "/my/output" as an output folder, sub folder will be created at "/my/output/gwd-to-component"
\t -p \t is Your desired project name. Please name the project with lower-case latters and not special charecter included.
\t\t This package will create new folder under "gwd-to-component-output" folder. Your project name will be used as folder name.
\t -c \t is Your preferred container ID which you can use as a component on your webpage so that you can use this HTML code
\t\t <div id="my-container-id"></div>
\t -l \t is your preferred LINK id (HTML DOM ID) which you will use to import the component to your webpage. On your
\t\t webpage use this HTML code <link id="my-link-id" rel="import" href="/gdw/output/path/index.html">
\t -u \t is host URL that will host your project folder including http or https and port without trailling slash.
\t\t If you decide to host your components on "Github Page" then host URL might be "https://username.github.io/repository"
\t\t and upload your project folder to the root folder of your repository. This option will be ommited if ".dependencies.json"
\t\t exists as we want every component in the project has the same host URL.
